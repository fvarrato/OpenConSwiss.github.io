# OpenCon 2018 Switzerland

## What is OpenCon?

[OpenCon](http://www.opencon2017.org "OpenCon Homepage") is a platform for the next generation to learn about Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data, develop critical skills, and catalyse action toward a more open system for sharing the world’s information -- from scholarly and scientific research, to educational materials, to digital research data.

Over the years, OpenCon has inspired a number of researchers, librarians, educators and members of civil society to advocate for a more open and transparent access to scientific information. It is an event where individuals involved in projects advancing the state of open science meet to discuss best practice and share experience with others.

## Why OpenCon Switzerland?

We believe that Switzerland would greatly benefit from a similar forum in the country, and therefore we plan to organise a OpenCon satellite event in Bern. We aim to bring open science practictioners together with individuals advocating for openness in other contexts. We believe such a forum will catalyse a conversation around *open-* topics at the national level and give the opportunity for active *open-* advocates to meet and connect, within Switzerland and with the international community.

OpenCon satellite events benefit from the support of [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org "The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition") and [R2RC](http://www.righttoresearch.org "The Right to Research Coalition"), two coalitions organising the annual OpenCon.  Since 2014, over 4'000 people have attended over 70 satellite events in 32 countries.  Instructions on how to host OpenCon satellites are available on the [OpenCon website](http://www.opencon2017.org/satellite "Host an OpenCon Satellite Event").

## Who Should Attend?

OpenCon is mainly targeted at the next-generation of open science advocates.  They can be early career researchers - from doctoral students to young PIs - actively promoting openness in their research field, librarians promoting openness in their institutions, publishers who have a strong open access vision, policy advisors and administrators involved in setting the open science or open government agendas, and advocates for open culture from the civil society.
